Please permit me the cliche. This post has been cooking for over 2 months at this point. That's not an admission of fastidious hardwork in creating a compelling narrative, it's a statement of how busy I have been since April 27 2025. Naturally the follow-on question is, 'What happened April 27 2025?', well I'm glad you asked.

I left my role as an Account Solutions Engineer and stepped into a specialisation role. The reasoning for the move was simple, I needed to move away from being across a whole portfolio. The specialisation role I have stepped into has been focused on all things Datacentre. It runs the whole gamut of solutions in the datacentre space and it's where I want to be. One simply needs to look at the news and the renewed vigour in all things datacentre to understand the more mercenary reasons.

Why be so vain to write a post on your own site about that move? Vanity. Well vanity and a thought that documenting the transition could be helpful at a later date. Moving on from a role can be a tricky thing to do. Especially so when you are moving internally within the same sector! You need to maintain positive relationships with the team(s) you're moving away from, build positive relationships with the individual(s) taking on your previous role, AND maintain positive relationships with the end clients from which you are stepping back.

I personally found it to be a slightly awkward dance. All elbows, left feet galore, and a little too much 'Cha Cha Slide'. The handover was intended to be gradual with a swan-like baton swap, but in reality the demands of the new role were too much for that approach. The hard cutover after May 2025 was a blunt end to a set of relationships that in some instances had been 24-36 months in creating. That's not to say I was disheartened at the rapid ramp-up; it was precisely what I wanted, trial by fire and all that. Simply, upon reflection, I could have handled that handover better.

The potted history successfully recorded, where does that leave things now? Demand generation & patch analysis primarily, with live demonstrations in a close second. Living a problem is far different to observing the problem, and it's already abundantly clear where improvements could be made. Cue the, internal meetings, request for ideas, budget requests, and the eventual execution. However, this is longitudinal and not immediate which is always a tough pill for me to swallow. Time heals all, I just need to learn the patience to enable time to do its thing.

This chapter is exciting, anxiety-laden, and ultimately a challenge I will either rise to or, not. Forever the optimistic, and the leader of my own cheer, I am confident I will rise to it - there's no real alternative!
