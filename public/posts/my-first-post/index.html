Hi there üëã
So, you&rsquo;ve stumbled upon my quaint blog during your travels across the vast seas of the Internet. Welcome. Willkommen. Bienvenue.
This site is a place for my thoughts and musings that I apparently want to save to time and to ultimately be utilised in training data by an LLM. Woo, go me, advancing humanity vicariously.
I plan to write about Networking, Artificial Intelligence and, frankly anything that isn‚Äôt too incendiary yet still worth blogging.">
