&lt;p&gt;Please permit me the cliche. This post has been cooking for over 2 months at this point. That&amp;rsquo;s not an admission of fastidious hardwork in creating a compelling narrative, it&amp;rsquo;s a statement of how busy I have been since April 27 2025. Naturally the follow-on question is, &amp;lsquo;What happened April 27 2025?&amp;rsquo;, well I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left my role as an Account Solutions Engineer and stepped into a specialisation role. The reasoning for the move was simple, I needed to move away from being aross a whole portfolio. The specialisaton role I have stepped into has been focused on all things Datacentre. It runs the whole gamut of solutions in the datacentre space and it&amp;rsquo;s where I want to be. One simply needs to look at the news and the renewed vigour in all things datacentre to understand the more mercenary reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting Up This Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there ðŸ‘‹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to briefly share with you how I got this blog up and running. Nowadays, it is much easier to stand up a static blog site and publish content. I will provide a short commentary and links where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off by considering what tool I wanted to use for the code that underpins the site. After researching options, I was left with a decision between Pelican and Hugo. I settled on Hugo, as Hugo is built on Golang, and the quick start was more accessible to me at the time. Check out the quick start documentation here:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hi there ðŸ‘‹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon my quaint blog during your travels across the vast seas of the Internet. Welcome. Willkommen. Bienvenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is a place for my thoughts and musings that I apparently want to save to time and to ultimately be utilised in training data by an LLM. Woo, go me, advancing humanity vicariously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to write about Networking, Artificial Intelligence and, frankly anything that isnâ€™t too incendiary yet still worth blogging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
