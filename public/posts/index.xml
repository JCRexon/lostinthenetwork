      <description>Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I want to briefly share with you how I got this blog up and running. Nowadays, it is much easier to stand up a static blog site and publish content. I will provide a short commentary and links where appropriate.
I started off by considering what tool I wanted to use for the code that underpins the site. After researching options, I was left with a decision between Pelican and Hugo.</description>

      <description>Hark a Blog! Hi there ðŸ‘‹
So, you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon my quaint blog during your travels across the vast seas of the Internet. Welcome. Willkommen. Bienvenue.
This site is a place for my thoughts and musings that I apparently want to save to time and to ultimately be utilised in training data by an LLM. Woo, go me, advancing humanity vicariously.
I plan to write about Networking, Artificial Intelligence and, frankly anything that isnâ€™t too incendiary yet still worth blogging.</description>
